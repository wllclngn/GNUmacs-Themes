# GNUmacs Themes

mondo2k theme is a fork of Nicholas M. Van Horn's Cyberpunk Theme. As with the original, mondo2k is designed for use with deftheme in iterations of GNU Emacs 24.1+. This theme, specifically, is a fork which aims to update Cyberpunk's colors on a color-by-color basis.

dome theme is a fork of Nicholas M. Van Horn's Cyberpunk Theme. As with the original, dome is designed for use with deftheme in iterations of GNUmacs 24.1+. It is a stripped down (perhaps overly simplified) fork which melds colors from my personal terminal's colors and Cyberpunk's original appearance. The name has no literal meaning.

terminal theme is inspired by old school terminals: Background and green text.
